# What is my eye color?
A computer vision project that determines eye color from images of human faces.

[OpenCV](https://opencv.org) is leveraged for most of the heavy lifting.

## Project structure

- [`library`](#library)
- [`cli`](#cli)
- [`gui`](#gui)
- [`share`](#share)

### `library`
A high-level Scala library that exposes the following capabilities:

- face detection
- eye detection
- pupil detection
- iris detection
- eye color detection
- color quantization

### `cli`
A command line interface for executing the capabilities present in the library.

An example invocation, using the sbt interactive shell, is demonstrated below. It executes the full eye color detection pipeline on an included [Lenna image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna) and displays the results:
```
$ sbt
> project cli
> run -W all -i /images/lena.png -O /tmp
```

### share
Bundled OpenCV libraries.

## Credits and notes
Face and eye detection simply defers to the LBP and Haar classifiers present in OpenCV.

Pupil center detection is largely based on [the work of Tristan Hume](http://thume.ca/projects/2012/11/04/simple-accurate-eye-center-tracking-in-opencv/), which is largely based on [the research of Timm and Barth](http://www.inb.uni-luebeck.de/publikationen/pdfs/TiBa11b.pdf).

Pupil radius and iris detection is both naive and (somewhat) novel. Both detection mechanisms search for circles originating at the pupil center. Pupil radius detection iteratively searches for the largest, darkest contour in a given search space.

Iris detection generates possible choices and decides which radius is best given the fact that if the search space extends too wide, the resulting circle will begin to accumulate white pixels since the sclera of the eye is white in color.
